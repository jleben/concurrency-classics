## Dining Philosophers

Solution 1 (Jyoti)

Solution 2 (Jakob):

Philosophers are either left handed or right handed, which means
they will always pick their left fork first or their right fork first.
Moreover, they are seated in alternating order depeding on main hand:
left-handed, right-handed, left-handed, ... This prevents deadlock where
all philosophers would pick their left fork first and wait for their right
fork.

Solution 3 (Jakob):

Forks decide which philosopher can pick them up. Each fork
alternates between offering itself to the philosopher on the left or on the
right. In addition, forks are placed in such an order that they start their
behavior in alternating states: start-left, start-right, start-left, ...
This way, there is a constantly changing set of pairs of adjacent forks that
are offered to the same philosophers, so they can eat.

### Solution 1 Evaluation

...

### Solution 2 Evaluation

Forks are represented simply by mutexes, and when a philosopher wants to eat,
he tries to acquire two mutexes representing his left and right forks.
This solution is faster than the CSP solution (3), because it uses minimum
amount of synchronization, but it doesn't treat all philosophers equally, when
there is an odd number of philosophers. Due to assymetry, some philosophers
are at disadvantage.

Distribution and total timing of 10.000 cycles of thinking and eating
performed collectively by all philosophers:
```
0: 2464
1: 2266
2: 2315
3: 1282
4: 1673
Total time = 928.186 ms
```

With 6 philosophers instead of 5, the distribution is more even:
```
0: 1612
1: 1742
2: 1634
3: 1716
4: 1672
5: 1624
Total time = 925.85 ms
```

### Solution 3 Evaluation

In this CSP solution, forks are processes (threads) on their own.
They repeat the cycle of awaiting 4 different signals in this order:
- left-philosopher-picked
- left-philosopher-dropped
- right-philosopher-picked
- right-philosopher-dropped

Philosophers try to send signals to their left and right forks in this order:
- left fork: right-philosopher-picked
- right fork: left-philosopher-picked
- left fork: right-philosopher-dropped
- right fork: left-philosopher-dropped

Because in CSP writes are blocking, whenever a philosopher tries to send
a signal, he will block until the fork is awaiting that particular signal.

Because forks are being offered exactly to the philosopher on their left or
right in alternation, there is never any racing for forks, and the
distribution among philosophers is completely fair.

However, as usual in CSP solutions, the extra threads for forks and
extra synchronization slows down the implementation:
```
0: 2000
1: 2000
2: 2000
3: 2000
4: 2000
Total time = 1.74805 s
```

## Cigarette Smokers

Solution 1 (Jyoti)

Solution 2 (Jakob):

The table is considered a monitor â€“ since a lock is always owned by anyone
operating on smoking ingredients on the table (and for the whole of that time),
it is of little importance that smokers need two individual ingredients: while
having exclusive access to the table, they can always check whether both of the
2 ingredients match their needs, and then either pick both or none.

Solution 3 (Jakob):

A CSP solution: there are 4 processes: the dealer, and 3 smokers. The table is
abstracted away: the dealer has access to each smokers' channel, and writes
ingredients to that particular channel, after having randomly selected a smoker.
Again, it is of no importance that there exist different ingredients:
The individual smokers' channels could have different data types (tuples of 2
different ingredients), but that would only artificially complicate the
implementation without actually modifying the concurrent structure. Smokers
simply loop waiting for anything to be written on their single input channel.



### Solution 2 Evaluation:

The problem (and implementation) is so simple, that as long as the distribution
of the dealer's random process of ingredient selection is uniform, the smoker
threads will be treated farily.

Distribution and total time of 10000 cigarettes smoked collectively by all
smokers, averaged across 5 runs:
```
1: 3330.8
2: 3317.6
3: 3350.6
Total Time = 1827.412 ms
```

### Solution 3 Evaluation:

Again, fairness is simply ensured by the uniformity of the random ingredient
selection process. In this particular case, the concurrent structure is also
very simple, so the overhead of CSP (extra synchronization for blocking
writes) is almost negligible compared to the monitor-type solution 2.

Distribution and total time of 10000 cigarettes smoked collectively by all
smokers, averaged across 5 runs:
```
1: 3333
2: 3345.2
3: 3320.8
Total Time = 1906.374 ms
```
